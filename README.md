# magnitool
A short program written while learning the basics of VB. It's purpose is to magnify areas of the screen in order to act as a scope in online games, without using any input from the game itself.

The current iteration is highly unstable, further work is unlikely due to the source code being lost.

The `esc` key is the only way to fully close the program, stay woke.

Takes advantage of windows dynamic super resolution to create a scope for windowed games. Scale your monitor to a higher resolution to increase the clarity when pixel sniping.
